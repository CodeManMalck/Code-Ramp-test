## Bart and Muni Colors

Give all the public transit lines the right color!

Take a look at the first bullet point under Bay Area Bart listing the Richmond-SFO/Millbrae line. How did it get styled like that? Now read the HTML and CSS for this line. Using this as an example, style all the remaining Bart and MUNI lines with their respective colors.

Feel free to just use standard named CSS colors like `red`, `orange`, etc.

- If you're done early, give the Muni lines an extra style boost and make them look like they do in the legend of the map.
